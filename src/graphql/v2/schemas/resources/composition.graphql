Composition
    A set of healthcare-related information that is assembled together into a
    single logical package that provides a single coherent statement of meaning,
    establishes its own context and that has clinical attestation with regard to
    who is making the statement. A Composition defines the structure and narrative
    content necessary for a document. However, a Composition alone does not
    constitute a document. Rather, the Composition must be the first entry in a
    Bundle where Bundle.type=document, and any other resources referenced from
    Composition must be included as subsequent entries in the Bundle (for example
    Patient, Practitioner, Encounter, etc.).
