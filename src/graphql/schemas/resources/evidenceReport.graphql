EvidenceReport
    The EvidenceReport Resource is a specialized container for a collection of
    resources and codable concepts, adapted to support compositions of Evidence,
    EvidenceVariable, and Citation resources and related concepts.
    If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions
