Composition
    A set of healthcare-related information that is assembled together into a
    single logical package that provides a single coherent statement of meaning,
    establishes its own context and that has clinical attestation with regard to
    who is making the statement. A Composition defines the structure and narrative
    content necessary for a document. However, a Composition alone does not
    constitute a document. Rather, the Composition must be the first entry in a
    Bundle where Bundle.type=document, and any other resources referenced from
    Composition must be included as subsequent entries in the Bundle (for example
    Patient, Practitioner, Encounter, etc.).
    If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions
