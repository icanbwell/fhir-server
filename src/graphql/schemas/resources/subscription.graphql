Subscription
    The subscription resource is used to define a push-based subscription from a
    server to another system. Once a subscription is registered with the server,
    the server checks every resource that is created or updated, and if the
    resource matches the given criteria, it sends a message on the defined
    "channel" so that another system can take an appropriate action.
    If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions
