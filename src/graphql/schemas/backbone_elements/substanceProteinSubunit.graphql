    SubstanceProtein.Subunit
        A SubstanceProtein is defined as a single unit of a linear amino acid
    sequence, or a combination of subunits that are either covalently linked or
    have a defined invariant stoichiometric relationship. This includes all
    synthetic, recombinant and purified SubstanceProteins of defined sequence,
    whether the use is therapeutic or prophylactic. This set of elements will be
    used to describe albumins, coagulation factors, cytokines, growth factors,
    peptide/SubstanceProtein hormones, enzymes, toxins, toxoids, recombinant
    vaccines, and immunomodulators.
