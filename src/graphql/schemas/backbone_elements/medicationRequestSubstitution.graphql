    MedicationRequest.Substitution
        An order or request for both supply of the medication and the instructions for
    administration of the medication to a patient. The resource is called
    "MedicationRequest" rather than "MedicationPrescription" or "MedicationOrder"

    plans, etc., and to harmonize with workflow patterns.
