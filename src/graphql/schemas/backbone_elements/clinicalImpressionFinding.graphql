    ClinicalImpression.Finding
        A record of a clinical assessment performed to determine what problem(s) may
    affect the patient and before planning the treatments or management strategies
    that are best to manage a patient's condition. Assessments are often 1:1 with
    a clinical consultation / encounter,  but this varies greatly depending on the
    clinical workflow. This resource is called "ClinicalImpression" rather than
    "ClinicalAssessment" to avoid confusion with the recording of assessment tools
    such as Apgar score.
