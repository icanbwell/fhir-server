    SubstanceAmount
        Chemical substances are a single substance type whose primary defining element
    is the molecular structure. Chemical substances shall be defined on the basis
    of their complete covalent molecular structure; the presence of a salt
    (counter-ion) and/or solvates (water, alcohols) is also captured. Purity,
    grade, physical form or particle size are not taken into account in the
    definition of a chemical substance or in the assignment of a Substance ID.
        If the element is present, it must have a value for at least one of the
    defined elements, an @id referenced from the Narrative, or extensions
