    SubstanceSourceMaterial.Organism
        Source material shall capture information on the taxonomic and anatomical
    origins as well as the fraction of a material that can result in or can be
    modified to form a substance. This set of data elements shall be used to
    define polymer substances isolated from biological matrices. Taxonomic and
    anatomical origins shall be described using a controlled vocabulary as
    required. This information is captured for naturally derived polymers ( .
    starch) and structurally diverse substances. For Organisms belonging to the
    Kingdom Plantae the Substance level defines the fresh material of a single
    species or infraspecies, the Herbal Drug and the Herbal preparation. For
    Herbal preparations, the fraction information will be captured at the
    Substance information level and additional information for herbal extracts
    will be captured at the Specified Substance Group 1 information level. See for
    further explanation the Substance Class: Structurally Diverse and the herbal
    annex.
