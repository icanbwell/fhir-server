ClinicalImpression

    affect the patient and before planning the treatments or management strategies

    a clinical consultation / encounter,  but this varies greatly depending on the
    clinical workflow. This resource is called "ClinicalImpression" rather than
    "ClinicalAssessment" to avoid confusion with the recording of assessment tools
