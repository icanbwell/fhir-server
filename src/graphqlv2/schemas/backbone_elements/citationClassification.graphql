Citation.Classification
    The Citation Resource enables reference to any knowledge artifact for purposes
    of identification and attribution. The Citation Resource supports existing
    reference structures and developing publication practices such as versioning,
    expressing complex contributorship roles, and referencing computable
    resources.
