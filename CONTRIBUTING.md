## Indexing
The process for adding/updating an index:
1. Edit [src/indexes/customIndexes.js](src/indexes/customIndexes.js) to add your indexes
2. Commit to main
3. There are two ways to apply these indexes to Mongo:
   1. For small collections, you can run indexing by going to `/index/run` url endpoint. To drop and create indexes use the `/index/rebuild` endpoint.
   2. For larger collections, run the admin script [src/admin/scripts/indexCollections.js](src/admin/scripts/indexCollections.js) using the instructions in Admin Scripts section above.
4. These will check for any missing indexes and add them to mongo.

Note: Indexes are automatically created when a new resource type is added to the server (if the `CREATE_INDEX_ON_COLLECTION_CREATION` environment variable is set).


## Index hinting

Some mongo implementations (such as AWS DocumentDB) are not very good at selecting an index to serve a query. Hence we've added an index hinting feature that compares the columns in the query with the existing indexes and adds a hint to mongo to use that index. This feature can be turned on by setting the `SET_INDEX_HINTS` environment variable.

## How to add/update custom rendering views

[renderingViews.md](renderingViews.md)

## IoC (Inversion of Control)

This project uses IoC (inversion of control). The container is defined in [SimpleContainer](src/utils/simpleContainer.js).

The container is set up in [src/createContainer.js](src/createContainer.js).  
This is where all the classes are instantiated with the parameters to other classes.

If you add a new class, you can instantiate it here.

If you add a new parameter to an existing class, you can pass it here.

For testing, you can override the classes in the container in [src/tests/createTestContainer.js](src/tests/createTestContainer.js).
This allows you to test the code by swapping out classes with your mock classes.

See MockKafka client for an example.

## Admin Scripts
This project has admin scripts in [src/admin/scripts](src/admin/scripts).

To run the admin scripts, you can start on any linux machine.

### First time setup

#### 1. Install Git
```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
```

#### 2. install NVM (Node Version Manager)
```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

#### 3. restart your computer

#### 4. install node
```shell
nvm install
nvm use
npm install -g npm@latest
```

#### 5. Get code
```shell
git clone https://github.com/icanbwell/fhir-server.git
cd fhir-server
```

#### 6. install npm packages
```shell
npm install
```

#### 7. set up credentials to connect to mongo
```shell
cp src/admin/scripts/.env.template src/admin/scripts/.env
nano src/admin/scripts/.env
```

#### 8. Run the admin script e.g.,
```shell
NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=1609600 node --max-old-space-size=1609600 src/admin/scripts/partitionAuditEvent.js --from=2022-08-01 --to=2022-09-01 --batchSize=10000
```

```shell
git reset --hard
```

#### if you want to use a branch different than main
```shell
git clone --branch separate_partitioners_into_classes --single-branch https://github.com/icanbwell/fhir-server.git
```

## Partitioning
Partitioning means we can store a collection as multiple partitioned collections based on a partitioner.

This is useful for really large tables and when the pattern of usage is specific.  Partitioning can result in faster performance.

For example, the AuditEvent collection is partitioned by year-month of the recorded date.

For a collection to be partitioned:
1. You have to specify in [src/partitioners/partitions.json](src/partitioners/partitions.json) how you want the collection to be partitioned.
2. If you need a new type of partitioner, then you can implement a sub-class of [src/partitioners/basePartitioner.js](src/partitioners/basePartitioner.js).  
   1. For example: [src/partitioners/yearMonthPartitioner.js](src/partitioners/yearMonthPartitioner.js)
3. If you added a new type of partitioner then you need to add calls to it from the PartitionManager in [src/partitioners/partitioningManager.js](src/partitioners/partitioningManager.js)
4. In addition we use the environment variable `PARTITION_RESOURCES` to turn on /off partitioning for each environment
   1. e.g., `PARTITION_RESOURCES: 'AuditEvent'`

If you have existing data, you need to copy it into partitioned collections.  You can use an admin script like [src/admin/scripts/partitionAuditEvent.js](src/admin/scripts/partitionAuditEvent.js).  Once you are done copying it, you can drop the original collection.

## Access indexes
A number of queries include searching on security tags:

https://fhir.staging.icanbwell.com/4_0_0/AuditEvent?_elements=id&_security=https://www.icanbwell.com/access%7Cmyhealth

Since security tags is an array, Mongo is not able to figure out that this can be "covered" by the index (Each item in the array is stored as a separate entry in the index.)

To optimize this, the FHIR server stores an extra field called `_access` with each resource.  In the case, above there would be a value of `_access.myhealth: 1` stored in Mongo for this resource.

Note that for smaller tables the improvement is negligible so this technique is most beneficial for huge tables.

First set this environment variable to enable using access indexes in an environment:
```USE_ACCESS_INDEX: 1```

To specify that the access index should be used for a collection, you add the resource type to the environment variable:
```COLLECTIONS_ACCESS_INDEX: "AuditEvent"```

You can specify "all" if you want to apply this to all.  See [src/admin/scripts/createAccessIndexField.js](src/admin/scripts/createAccessIndexField.js) admin script to create the _access fields in old data.


Now the FHIR server will automatically rewrite the query for https://fhir.staging.icanbwell.com/4_0_0/AuditEvent?_elements=id&_security=https://www.icanbwell.com/access%7Cmyhealth from:
```javascript
db.AuditEvent_4_0_0.find({'$and':[{'meta.lastUpdated':{'$lt':ISODate('2022-09-14T00:00:00.000Z')}},{'meta.lastUpdated':{'$gte':ISODate('2022-09-13T00:00:00.000Z')}},{'meta.security':{'$elemMatch':{'system':'https://www.icanbwell.com/access','code':'medstar'}}}]}, {'id':1,'_id':0}).sort({'id':1}).limit(200)
```
to:
```javascript
db.AuditEvent_4_0_0.find({'$and':[{'meta.lastUpdated':{'$lt':ISODate('2022-09-14T00:00:00.000Z')}},{'meta.lastUpdated':{'$gte':ISODate('2022-09-13T00:00:00.000Z')}},{'_access.medstar':1}]}, {'id':1,'_id':0}).sort({'id':1}).limit(200)
```

Since this will now use the _access field, it will be "covered" by our index so Mongo can return the ids completely from the index without needing to go to the actual data.

If you have old data that did not have this _access field, then you can run an admin script to add this to existing data.
    
## Admin UI
This FHIR server provides an admin UI at `/admin`.  There are various tools here for administration.

To access the admin tools you need the `admin/*.read` scopes in your OAuth login.

### Log Lookup Admin UI
Here you can enter the X-Request_Id the FHIR server returns and be able to see the logs relating to that request.

### Index Management UI
Here you can see:
1. What the current indexes are
2. Which indexes are mismatched between the config [src/indexes/customIndexes.js](src/indexes/customIndexes.js) and the underlying databases.
3. Synchronize the indexes between the config and the databases by creating any missing indexes and removing any extraneous indexes.

## Logging
Logging in FHIR server is implemented using Winston[https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston] to log in JSON format. Reason to use this is to enhance & unify the fhir server logging.

The default configuration for winston logger is in: https://github.com/icanbwell/fhir-server/blob/master/src/winstonInit.js. Child loggers are used to implement logging for admin logs & fhir server logs.

### How to use
1. Import functions from: https://github.com/icanbwell/fhir-server/blob/master/src/operations/common/logging.js as per requirement. 
2. Functions logInfo, logDebug, logError & logWarn take 2 arguments 'message' & 'args', where 'message' is a string & args take object arguments. Any number of args can be send according to the requirement.
For example: 
```
logInfo('Logger Message', {user});
```
Output: 
```
{"dd":{"service":"bwell-fhir-server","version":"0.0.1"},"level":"info","logger":"default","message":"Logger Message","timestamp":"Feb-10-2023 10:10:10+00:00","user":{"name":"Demo name"}}
```

## Admin Logger
Admin logger can be used by making instance of class `AdminLogger` class. Then you can use `logInfo` & `logError` methods accordingly.
For example:
```
const adminLogger = new AdminLogger();
adminLogger.logInfo('Logger Message');
```
Output:
```
{"dd":{"service":"bwell-fhir-server","version":"0.0.1"},"level":"info","logger":"admin","message":"Logger Message","timestamp":"Feb-10-2023 10:10:10+00:00"}
```

## Search UI
Search Form is rendered by [src/views/partials/searchForm.ejs](src/views/partials/searchForm.ejs)

When the user presses the Search button, this script [src/dist/js/search.js](src/dist/js/search.js) bundles up 
the user entered values and sends to `/_search` endpoint on the server.

The results are shown by [src/views/pages/SearchResult.ejs](src/views/pages/SearchResult.ejs).

Clicking on the search results is handled by [src/dist/js/searchResults.js](src/dist/js/searchResults.js).
Helper functions are in [src/utils/searchForm.util.js](src/utils/searchForm.util.js).
